# Creative Coding Year 4 - Colour
## Example 5 - Pixel Array

[Go back to Colour](../)

For this pixel array example. I have split up the final sketch into four separate steps. Slowly building on the basic idea and adding more complexities.

The pixel array allows us to access the RGBA values of each pixel within an image. This allows us to create a "pixelated" effect of an image.

We can then use p5's built in sortColours function to manipulate the "pixels" we have created into certain orders.

1. [Step 1](Step1/)
2. [Step 2](Step2/)
3. [Step 3](Step3/)
4. [Step 4](Step4/)
