In this example the canvas is split up into lines where each line has a 50/50 chance of either being drawn from the top left to bottom right or bottom left to top right. this results in a maze like image. If the lines are redrawn in a new random order. The user can always press 1-3 to change the stroke cap from rounded, square and project respectively.
