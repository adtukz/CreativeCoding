The Swiss clock was created for the first test assignment. We had to create a Swiss clock that uses one loop to draw all the ticks of the clock to the canvas and then create a minute, second and hour hand to display the current time.

The assignment uses ```javascript push()``` and ```javascript pop()``` to allow the centre of rotation on the canvas to be in locations
