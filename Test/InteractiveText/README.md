# Creative Coding Year 4 - Assignments
## Assignment Two - Interactive Text

[Go back to Assignments](../) or [See the sketch in action!](sketch.html)

This assignment allows a user to control text in many ways. The user can choose what text is drawn to the screen, it appears as dots rather than text. These dots are then manipulated to allow for interactivity.

The additions I added to this from the base application created are:
* 1. Lines instead of dots, choose between vertical and horizontal
* 2. Noise to jitter the lines, amount of jitter depends on cursor location
* 3. Animation to draw dots from top to bottom, or left to right
* 4. Rotating lines based on cursor position
* 5. Change colour based on a number of colour palettes
